    Well I made it  1200 miles already, and I passed
     through some interesting place om the way:
     </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Walla Walla,Wa</li>
      <li>Magic City, ID</li>
      <li>Bountidul, UT</li>
      <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
      <li>Why, AZ</li>
      <li> Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ol>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the 
      road today; "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get 
      you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be Passing
      any cars.

      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li>iPod</li>
      <LI>digital camera</LI>
      <li>a protein bar</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles
        begins with one Segway.</q>
